I was responsible for data encoding in the data_encoding_correction.py file. I wrote the code that encoded plain text into byte mode using the ISO 8859-1 character set that's then used in another function to split the data into bytes and applies the Reed-Solomon error correction method to then return the fully encoded bitsteam. The main challenge I faced was simply learning so much new stuff about QR-Code generation and applying it to my work, I thought it'd be a simpler process. If I was going to do this coursework again, I'd stick to the qr-code tutorial link that was given as that was the most helpful and try stray away from other resources.
