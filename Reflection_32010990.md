I was involved in making project enhancements, basic interactive QR data representation and documentation. During project enhancements I was assigned to fulfil the majority of 
creating an automated version selection, which was a joint-partnership work completion with one of my groupmates, and I was tasked with the implementation of user options to 
modify QR rendering. For QR data representation, I was partially involved in creating basic GUI / website interactivity. Overall, I think that this coursework was tough because 
the group overall lacked communication therefore we couldn’t communicate our ideas and corresponding ideas clashed often with each other, causing unambiguity that could’ve been 
avoided if we used basic communication, resulting in losing time. However, I also found it fun as I enjoyed the tasks where I was entrusted the majority/complete completion of 
because it allowed me to think more creatively, permitting flexibility and freedom/creative control. To improve, our group can improve communication by arranging a set time, 
discussing and sharing each of our ideas thoroughly, eliminating unambiguity, ensuring a clear direction/vision for the coursework.
