During this coursework, I assisted on working these three files of code: data_masking.py, powerpoint.py and katieResearch.md. In data_masking.py, I helped out in applying the QR code masking patterns and also calculating penalities in which I was able to learn how both of these can affect readability and error correction. This coding file is relevant in ensuring that the QR code generation can be manually handled. In powerpoint.py, I assisted in extracting information from katieResearch.md and ensured to display this by using Tkinter, enhancing my understanding of making sure to build a user friendly interface. The katieResearch.md file details has githe core information necessary for creating QR codes, which provided me with a better understanding of making QR codes manually even more. Overall, the coursework gave me the chance to apply what I have learnt in lectures and practicals into the coursework and despite the fact the QR logic does work, I think what could have make the experience more engaging is if I had suggested more customisable features to be added.
