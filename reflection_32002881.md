In this project, I contributed to the development of data_encoding_correction.py, data_masking.py, and qr_gui.py, working alongside my group to build a functional and intuitive QR code system. One of the key challenges we faced was communication, especially during the early stages of the assignment. Coordinating our efforts while working on overlapping code sections led to uncertainty, and so a more individualistic approach towards our contributions could be a better way of approaching a group project in the future. Overall, considering I have used python before coming to university, I think I found the coursework more challenging than I expected.
