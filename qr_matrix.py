Current Task:

Matrix Layout and Patterns: Finder patterns in corners, timing
pattern, dark module, format information area reserved. Zigzag
placement of the data/ECC bits in the right modules (skipping
reserved cells). Application of one masking pattern (any single
pattern is fine). Resulting text-based QR is structurally
consistent with Version 1 (21Ã—21) and version 2 (25x25).
